            <p>Earlier ullvischema.tk used ID-numbers to access the schedules, and the computer had to "remember" your ID-number to be able to "remember" your schedule. What the computer did to remember the ID-number was to store it in ullvischema's localStorage, with questionable security. Fortunately I have found another way. NovaSoftware left a list of tags with corresponding users in their source code. The tags works excacly like the ID-numbers, which is why i decided to completely abandon the old method. I copied the list to my code, and now I need to know who you are to find your tag. Once again, this is a one time process only.</p>
